These are my (Alexis Earley's) collection of programming projects from my college career.

Included in this collection are projects from my Programming 1 and 2 classes, which I took in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020, respectively.

This repository contains, from ny most recent project to my earliest project:
  * Programming 2 - all coded in C++
    * Minesweeper Project - In this project, we were asked to design our own working minesweeper game.
    * Image Processing Project - This project manipulates images, including (but not limited to) multiplying, subtracting, screening, overlaying, and flipping them.
    * Linked List Project - The point of this project was to learn about linked lists through designing one ourselves.
    
  * Programming 1 - all coded in Java
    * Gator Raider Project- Modeled after Pac-Man, this project allowed me to use a long list of already created functions to control the movement of the gator (or Pac-Man) i
      different situations. My programmed gator obtained the highest score in my class of 500 students.
    * Pakudex Project - This project, imitating the idea of a Pokedex, allowed me to list, show, add, evolve, and sort creatures, teaching me how to fluently use classes.
    * Graphical Output Project - Through this project, I learned how to load, read, and display images in different ways, including different binary and hex formats.
